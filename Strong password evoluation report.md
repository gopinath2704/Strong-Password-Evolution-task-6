# **Task 6 Report: Creating and Evaluating Strong Passwords**

## **Objective**

The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, evaluate different passwords using online password strength checkers, and learn how password complexity impacts security against common attacks.

---

## **Tools Used**

* **Password Strength Checker**: passwordmeter.com (or similar free online tools)

---

## **Methodology**

1. Created multiple passwords with different levels of complexity.
2. Used variations in:

   * Length
   * Uppercase and lowercase letters
   * Numbers
   * Special symbols
3. Tested each password using an online password strength checker.
4. Recorded the strength score and feedback.
5. Analyzed results to identify best practices.

## **Password Evaluation Results**

| Password        | Complexity Level | Length | Strength Score | Tool Feedback                              |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `password123`   | Very Weak        | 11     | ~15%           | Common word, predictable, easily guessable |
| `Password123`   | Weak             | 11     | ~35%           | Capital letter helps but still predictable |
| `Pass@123`      | Medium           | 8      | ~55%           | Short length reduces security              |
| `P@ssw0rd#2025` | Strong           | 13     | ~80%           | Good mix of characters                     |
| `G7#kL!2xQ@9m`  | Very Strong      | 12     | ~95%           | Random, complex, highly secure             |

## **Observations**

* Short passwords are weak even if they contain symbols.
* Common words (e.g., “password”) drastically reduce strength.
* Random passwords score higher than meaningful ones.
* Adding symbols and increasing length significantly improves security.

---

## **Common Password Attacks**

### **1. Brute Force Attack**

* Tries all possible combinations.
* Weak passwords are cracked quickly.
* Long and complex passwords increase cracking time exponentially.

### **2. Dictionary Attack**

* Uses a list of common words and leaked passwords.
* Passwords like `password123` fail instantly.
* Random character passwords resist this attack.

---

## **Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords**

* Minimum **12–16 characters**
* Use **uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols**
* Avoid dictionary words and personal information
* Do not reuse passwords
* Use **password managers** for storage
* Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

---

## **Tips Learned from Evaluation**

* Length is more important than complexity alone.
* Predictability is a major weakness.
* Random passwords are safest.
* Regular password changes reduce risk.
* Password strength tools help identify weaknesses.

---

## **Impact of Password Complexity on Security**

* Higher complexity increases resistance to brute-force attacks.
* Random passwords protect against dictionary attacks.
* Strong passwords significantly reduce account compromise risks.
* Complexity directly affects the time and resources needed for attackers.

---

## **Conclusion**

Password strength plays a critical role in cybersecurity. Through evaluation, it is clear that long, random, and complex passwords offer the highest level of protection against common attacks. Users should adopt strong password practices and utilize password managers and MFA to enhance security.
